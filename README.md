## Visualization of Stability and Phase Transitions in Bose–Einstein Condensate-Inspired Skyrme Models

### Task
Aim is to learn how to construct (numerically) visual representations and analyze the stability and phase transitions in a Skyrme-type model based on Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), also known as the BEC Skyrme model. These visualizations are critical in deciphering the model's physical attributes and transitions, resulting in a better understanding of the topological soliton dynamics. This is also associated with the entropy of a black hole.
